    "Nuestros_parrafo1": "The National University in its Liberia Campus has had a significant regeneration and biological enrichment that has been used to develop a university trail project called Los Matapalos, a name that derives from the abundance of this species and the leafy specimens that are at the trailhead.",
    "Nuestros_parrafo2": "The Los Matapalos trail had its beginnings around 2017 when, through different groups and races, they took on the challenge of reforesting and beginning to carry out studies that would allow proper management and through them the step to follow was decided.",
    "Nuestros_parrafo3": "The Los Matapalos trail officially opened its doors in 2019, and to date it has been visited by different community groups and institutions such as the Agricultural College, Adventist School, UCR of the province of Limón, older adults, a group of retired teachers from ADEP Liberia , among others. This trail emerged as a space for coexistence where the student population was allowed to be the interpreters of the trail and show its visitors its environmental, cultural and historical importance.",

    "Vivero_definicion": "It is a bamboo structure built in 2021 by Campus Liberia volunteers. In this space they work on issues of food and nutritional security, as well as responsible consumption and production. Vegetable gardens and seedbeds are developed in different modalities so that people who visit the nursery learn to produce their own food. Some of the foods that have been harvested are Capsicum annum (Chile), Coriandrum sativum (Coriander), Lactuca sativa (Lettuce), Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato). Translated with www.deepl.com/Translator (free version).",
    "Arboretum_definicion": "It is a collection of native flora of the dry tropical forest, located before entering the forest patch. In this area, there are about 50 species of trees such as Enterobolium cyclocarpum (Guanacaste), Samanea saman (Cenízaro), Guaiacum sanctum (Guayacán Real), Dalbergia retusa (Cocobolo), among others. The objective of the arboretum is that the people who share the campus can learn about the flora of the dry tropics and appreciate its value. The arboretum also contributes to the production of oxygen, a source of food and a niche for different species of fauna and, above all, to the landscaping of the campus. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
    "Melipo_definicion": "It was born in 2016, whose infrastructure consists of a bee hotel and technified rational boxes donated by students of the art and visual communication career to the volunteer group of the Liberia Campus. The objective of this space is to raise awareness of the importance of conserving native stingless bee species of Guanacaste.  Among the species are Frieseomelita paupera (White Wings), Melipona beechei (Cat's Beak), Tetragonisca angustula (Mariola) and Nannotrigona perilampoides (Chicopipe). The meliponary provides products such as honey, beehives and above all ecosystem services to the Campus. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
    "Reservorio_definicion": "The campus has a rainwater harvesting system, which was created in order to avoid flooding due to the topography where it is located. Therefore, all the rainwater that falls on the roofs goes down the canoes and drains to five storage tanks, each with a capacity of 215,000 liters. In 2021, in order to make use of this water, the first reservoir of the Campus was built with a capacity of 300,000 l, whose purpose is to meet the water needs of wildlife, which is monitored by camera traps located on the banks of the reservoir. In addition, Oreochromis niloticus (Tilapias) were introduced as a food source and aquatic flora for oxygenation of the reservoir.",
